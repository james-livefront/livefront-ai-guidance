### Vendor Risk Management

- **Q23:** What happens if an AI tool provider changes their terms of service or data handling practices?
- **Q24:** How should teams assess and monitor third-party AI tool security posture over time?
- **Q25:** What's the backup plan if a primary AI tool is compromised or discontinued?

---

## 5. Accessibility Requirements Missing

### AI Tool Accessibility

- **Q26:** How do vision-impaired developers effectively use AI coding tools that rely heavily on visual code review?
- **Q27:** Are there specific AI tools or configurations recommended for developers with disabilities?
- **Q28:** How does the team ensure AI-generated accessibility code is actually tested with assistive technologies?

### Content Accessibility

- **Q29:** The guide mentions WCAG 2.1 AA compliance but doesn't specify how to verify AI-generated accessibility features
- **Q30:** What's the testing protocol for AI-generated ARIA labels and screen reader compatibility?

---

## 6. Performance Requirements Missing

### Tool Performance Standards

- **Q31:** What are acceptable response times for AI tools during development workflows?
- **Q32:** How should teams handle AI tools that become slow or unreliable during critical project phases?
- **Q33:** What are the bandwidth and compute requirements for effective AI tool usage?

### Code Performance Standards

- **Q34:** How do teams validate that AI-generated code meets client-specific performance requirements?
- **Q35:** What's the protocol for performance testing AI-generated code before production deployment?

---

## 7. Error Handling Not Specified

### AI Tool Failures

- **Q36:** What's the fallback process when AI tools produce unusable or harmful code suggestions?
- **Q37:** How should teams handle situations where AI tools hallucinate non-existent APIs or libraries?
- **Q38:** What's the escalation process for repeated AI tool failures or quality issues?

### Code Quality Failures

- **Q39:** How do teams recover from AI-generated technical debt that wasn't caught during initial review?
- **Q40:** What's the process for addressing security vulnerabilities discovered in AI-generated code after deployment?

---

## 8. Platform-Specific Considerations

### Mobile Development

- **Q41:** How do the AI assistance patterns differ between iOS and Android development workflows?
- **Q42:** Are there platform-specific AI tools or prompts that work better for native mobile development?
- **Q43:** How should teams handle AI suggestions that work on one mobile platform but not others?

### Web vs. Mobile vs. Backend

- **Q44:** The guide focuses heavily on React Native but lacks specific guidance for pure web or backend development
- **Q45:** How do the security and sanitization protocols differ across different development contexts?
- **Q46:** What are the specific considerations for AI assistance in DevOps and infrastructure code?

### Cross-Platform Consistency

- **Q47:** How do teams ensure AI-generated code maintains consistency across different platforms and technologies?
- **Q48:** What's the strategy for sharing AI-generated components and patterns across platform teams?
